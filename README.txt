Max Takano's portfolio Readme A97073726

The brand I’m trying to communicate is cool and fun.  These generic words are the primary brand I’m trying to convey with my site.  This is down with the use of bright colors (my consistent bright purple, and gold when hovering over items) and the fun looking font choice.  Additionally I try to be cool by putting my ray traced images on the very front of my website, an eye catching first thing to see.  When you scroll down users see my fun app creator company name: MaxTapps, this is another attempt at being fun.  Many things in the site are interactive to display my coding ability, and descriptions are kept to a minimum to stay fun and light.  I also try to be unique and funny by writing interesting descriptions (like in my contact area).  My high value users are two different groups.  First I want to appeal to potential hirers, so I keep the website clean and somewhat professional.  I have my linked-in and resume at the bottom, and my email so I can be contacted easily if someone likes my work.  The second potentially larger group will be customers of my apps.  I hope to use this website as a hub for people who download my apps to check out.  My first  app boulder block should be up in the store soon and I will add a link to apple store for that app once it is up. Overall I hope my brand is clear, it could also be described as creative, yet clean, as that is the general feel of the aesthetics I was going for.
